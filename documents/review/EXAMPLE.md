|Awesome project|Jack Johnson, John Jackson|ACME|v2.1.0|

## Our goals with this project are to:
  1. Document a microservices architecture built with RabbitMQ.
  2. Create an SDK that will take care of connecting, sending, and receiving messages.

## We expect to:
  1. Be able to define my queues and exchanges in AsyncAPI.
  2. Have everything we need to make the SDK work.

## We found the following challenges or difficulties:

<!-- Please, repeat this block for every challenge/difficulty. -->

### 1. The AMQP extension doesn't work for us.
The AMQP extension doesn't allow me to define my queues and exchanges.

#### We think it can be solved by...
Improving the AMQP extension.

#### Overall, we think this challenge/difficulty is...
  * [ ] A "nice to have".
  * [ ] A blocker for us to adopt this version of the spec.
  * [x] Something that doesn't affect the specification.
