# AsyncAPI Specification Contribution Guide

AsyncAPI is an evolving language. This repository contains the
specification text as well as Pull Requests with suggested improvements and
contributions.

Contributions that do not change the interpretation of the spec but instead
improve legibility, fix editorial errors, clear up ambiguity and improve
examples are encouraged and are often merged by a spec Committer with
little process.

However, contributions that _do_ meaningfully change the interpretation of the
spec must follow an RFC (Request For Comments) process led by a *[champion](#champion-definition)*
through a series of *stages* intended to improve *visibility*, allow for
*discussion* to reach the best solution, and arrive at *consensus*. This process
becomes even more important as AsyncAPI's community broadens.

When proposing or weighing-in on any issue or pull request, consider the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to better understand expected and unacceptable behavior.


## Contributing to AsyncAPI Libraries

A common point of confusion for those who wish to contribute to AsyncAPI is where
to start. In fact, you may have found yourself here after attempting to make an
improvement to an AsyncAPI library. Should a new addition be made to the AsyncAPI
spec first or an AsyncAPI library first? Admittedly, this can become a bit of a
[chicken-or-egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) dilemma.

AsyncAPI libraries seek to be "spec compliant", which means they discourage
changes that cause them to behave differently from the spec as written. However,
they also encourage pull requests for changes that accompany an RFC *proposal*
or RFC *draft*. In fact, a spec contribution RFC won't be *accepted* until it
has experience being implemented in an AsyncAPI library.

To allow a library to remain spec compliant while also implementing *proposals*
and *drafts*, the library's maintainers may request that these new features are
disabled by default with opt-in option flags or they may simply wait to merge a
well-tested pull request until the spec proposal is *accepted*.


## Guiding Principles

AsyncAPI's evolution is guided by a few principles. Suggested contributions
should use these principles to guide the details of an RFC and decisions to
move forward.

* **Favor no change**

  As AsyncAPI is implemented in many languages under the collaboration
  of a lot of individuals, incorporating any change has a high cost.
  Accordingly, proposed changes must meet a very high bar of added value.
  The burden of proof is on the contributor to illustrate this value.

* **Enable new capabilities motivated by real use cases**

  Every change should intend on unlocking a real and reasonable use case. Real
  examples are always more compelling than theoretical ones, and common
  scenarios are more compelling than rare ones. RFCs should do more than offer
  a different way to reach an already achievable outcome.

* **Simplicity and consistency over expressiveness and terseness**

  "Possible but awkward" is often favored over more complex
  alternatives. Simplicity (e.g. fewer concepts) is more important than
  expressing more sophisticated ideas or writing less.

* **Preserve option value**

  It's hard to know what the future brings; whenever possible, decisions should
  be made that allow for more options in the future. Sometimes this is
  unintuitive: spec rules often begin more strict than necessary with a future
  option to loosen when motivated by a real use case.

* **Understandability is just as important as correctness**

  The AsyncAPI spec, despite describing technical behavior, is intended to be
  read by people. Use natural tone and include motivation and examples.


## RFC Contribution Champions

Contributing to AsyncAPI requires a lot of dedicated work. To set clear
expectations and provide accountability, each proposed RFC (request for
comments) must have a *champion* who is responsible for addressing feedback and
completing next steps. An RFC may have multiple *champions*. The spec Committers
are not responsible for completing RFCs which lack a *champion* (though a
Committer may be a *champion* for an RFC).

An RFC which does not have a *champion* may not progress through stages, and can
become stale. Stale proposals may be picked up by a new *champion* or may
be *rejected*.


## RFC Contribution Stages

RFCs are guided by a *champion* through a series of stages: *strawman*,
*proposal*, *draft*, and *accepted* (or *rejected*), each of which has suggested
entrance criteria and next steps detailed below. RFCs typically advance one
stage at a time, but may advance multiple stages at a time. Stage
advancements occur on GitHub.

In general, it's preferable to start with a pull request so that we can best
evaluate the RFC in detail. However, starting with an issue is also permitted if
the full details are not worked out.

All RFCs start as either a *strawman* or *proposal*.

## Stage 0: *Strawman*

An RFC at the *strawman* stage captures a described problem or
partially-considered solutions. A *strawman* does not need to meet any entrance
criteria. A *strawman's* goal is to prove or disprove a problem and guide
discussion towards either rejection or a preferred solution. A *strawman* may
be an issue or a pull request (though an illustrative pull request is preferrable).

*There is no entrance criteria for a Strawman*

As implied by the name [strawman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man_proposal),
the goal at this stage is to knock it down (*reject*) by considering other
possible related solutions, showing that the motivating problem can be solved
with no change to the specification, or that it is not aligned with the
*guiding principles*.

Once determined that the *strawman* is compelling, it should seek the entrance
criteria for *proposal*.


## Stage 1: *Proposal*

An RFC at the *proposal* stage is a solution to a problem with enough fidelity
to be discussed in detail. It must be backed by a willing *champion*. A
*proposal*'s goal is to make a compelling case for acceptance by describing
both the problem and the solution via examples and spec edits. A *proposal*
should be a pull request.

*Entrance criteria:*

* Identified *champion*
* Clear explanation of problem and solution
* Illustrative examples
* Incomplete spec edits
* Identification of potential concerns, challenges, and drawbacks

A *proposal* is subject to the same discussion as a *strawman*: ensuring that it
is well aligned with the *guiding principles*, is a problem worth solving, and
is the preferred solution to that problem. A *champion* is not expected to have
confidence in every detail at this stage and should instead focus on identifying
and resolving issues and edge-cases. To better understand the technical
ramifications of the *proposal*, a *champion* is encouraged to implement it in a
AsyncAPI library.

Most *proposals* are expected to evolve or change and may be rejected. Therefore,
it is unwise to rely on a *proposal* in a production environment. AsyncAPI
libraries *may* implement *proposals*, though are encouraged to not enable the
*proposed* feature without explicit opt-in.


## Stage 2: *Draft*

An RFC at the *draft* stage is a fully formed solution. There is
consensus the problem identified should be solved, and this particular solution
is preferred. A *draft's* goal is to precisely and completely describe the
solution and resolve any concerns through library implementations. A *draft*
must be a pull request.

*Entrance criteria:*

* Consensus the solution is preferred
* Resolution of identified concerns and challenges
* Precisely described with spec edits
* Compliant implementation in the [AsyncAPI JS Parser](https://www.github.com/asyncapi/parser-js) and the [AsyncAPI JSON Schema](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-node) (might not be merged)

A *proposal* becomes a *draft* when the set of problems or drawbacks have been
fully considered and accepted or resolved, and the solution is deemed
desirable. A *draft*'s goal is to complete final spec edits that are ready to
be merged and implement the *draft* in AsyncAPI libraries along with tests to
gain confidence that the spec text is sufficient.

*Drafts* may continue to evolve and change, occasionally dramatically, and are
not guaranteed to be accepted. Therefore, it is unwise to rely on a *draft* in a
production environment. AsyncAPI libraries *should* implement *drafts* to
provide valuable feedback, though are encouraged not to enable the *draft*
feature without explicit opt-in when possible.


## Stage 3: *Accepted*

An RFC at the *accepted* stage is a completed solution. According to a spec
Committer it is ready to be merged as-is into the spec document. The RFC is
ready to be deployed in AsyncAPI libraries. An *accepted* RFC must be
implemented in the [AsyncAPI JS Parser](https://www.github.com/asyncapi/parser-js) and the [AsyncAPI JSON Schema](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-node).

*Entrance criteria:*

* Consensus the solution is complete
* Complete spec edits, including examples and prose
* Compliant implementation in the [AsyncAPI JS Parser](https://www.github.com/asyncapi/parser-js) and the [AsyncAPI JSON Schema](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-node) (fully tested and merged or ready to merge)

A *draft* is *accepted* when the Committers have been convinced via
implementations and tests that it appropriately handles all edge cases; that the
spec changes not only precisely describe the new syntax and semantics but
include sufficient motivating prose and examples; and that the RFC includes
edits to any other affected areas of the spec. Once *accepted*, its *champion*
should encourage adoption of the RFC by opening issues or pull requests on other
popular AsyncAPI libraries.

An *accepted* RFC is merged into the AsyncAPI spec's master branch by a Committer
and will be included in the next released revision.


## Stage X: *Rejected*

An RFC may be *rejected* at any point and for any reason. Most rejections occur
when a *strawman* is proven to be unnecessary, is misaligned with the *guiding
principles*, or fails to meet the entrance criteria to become a *proposal*.
A *proposal* may become *rejected* for similar reasons as well as if it fails to
reach consensus or loses the confidence of its *champion*. Likewise a *draft*
may encounter unforeseen issues during implementations which cause it to lose
consensus or the confidence of its *champion*.

RFCs which have lost a *champion* will not be *rejected* immediately, but may
become *rejected* if they fail to attract a new *champion*.

Once *rejected*, an RFC will typically not be reconsidered. Reconsideration is
possible if a *champion* believes the original reason for rejection no longer
applies due to new circumstances or new evidence.

## Champion definition

A champion is anyone who leads the work on an RFC. It doesn't
mean it has to be the only person working on it though. They
are a "person of reference" for a given RFC implementation and
may or may not know about JS, relying on the help of other
community members to implement the RFC on the
[AsyncAPI JS Parser](https://www.github.com/asyncapi/parser-js) and the [AsyncAPI JSON Schema](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-node).
