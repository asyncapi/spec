## File naming

You may notice `asyncapi` in the the name of each example. We recommend doing the same with your AsyncAPI document. This way you enable features like documentation display on node hover, auto completion and validation of your AsyncAPI documents in IDEs like VSCode or IntelliJ IDEA. IDEs integrate with [SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) where AsyncAPI specification JSON Schema files are referenced. Some IDEs do it by default, some, like VSCode require you to install additional extensions, like `YAML` extension.

## Editors

To edit your AsyncAPI documents, you can use [AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/).

If you prefer to use your favourite IDE, there are official extensions for [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asyncapi.asyncapi-preview) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15673-asyncapi)
