#
# This example showcases usage of AsyncAPI for the purpose of describing a WebSocket API. It is based on a real public service maintained by company called Gemini that provides cryptocurency trading products. It uses AsyncAPI bindings.
#
# This AsyncAPI document describes their v1 of the API. The v2 is also available and changes in the way that it provides a multimessage channel, where you subscribe for messages by sending a subscription message instead of using query parameters. For example with multimessage channel check out this article https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/websocket-part2 about another real public API called Kraken

    Market data is a public API that streams all the market data on a given symbol.
    
    You can quickly play with the API using [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat#installation) like this:
    ```bash
    websocat wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/btcusd?heartbeat=true -S
    ```

            The semantics of entry type filtering is:

            If any entry type is specified as true or false, all of them must be explicitly flagged true to show up in the response
            If no entry types filtering parameters are included in the url, then all entry types will appear in the response

            NOTE: top_of_book has no meaning and initial book events are empty when only trades is specified
