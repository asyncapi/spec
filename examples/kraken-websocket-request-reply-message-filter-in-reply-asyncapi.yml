  title: Kraken Websockets API
  version: '1.8.0'
  description: |
    WebSockets API offers real-time market data updates. WebSockets is a bidirectional protocol offering fastest real-time data, helping you build real-time applications. The public message types presented below do not require authentication. Private-data messages can be subscribed on a separate authenticated endpoint. 

    ### General Considerations

    - TLS with SNI (Server Name Indication) is required in order to establish a Kraken WebSockets API connection. See Cloudflare's [What is SNI?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/) guide for more details.
    - All messages sent and received via WebSockets are encoded in JSON format
    - All decimal fields (including timestamps) are quoted to preserve precision.
    - Timestamps should not be considered unique and not be considered as aliases for transaction IDs. Also, the granularity of timestamps is not representative of transaction rates.
    - At least one private message should be subscribed to keep the authenticated client connection open.
    - Please use REST API endpoint [AssetPairs](https://www.kraken.com/features/api#get-tradable-pairs) to fetch the list of pairs which can be subscribed via WebSockets API. For example, field 'wsname' gives the supported pairs name which can be used to subscribe.
    - Cloudflare imposes a connection/re-connection rate limit (per IP address) of approximately 150 attempts per rolling 10 minutes. If this is exceeded, the IP is banned for 10 minutes.
    - Recommended reconnection behaviour is to (1) attempt reconnection instantly up to a handful of times if the websocket is dropped randomly during normal operation but (2) after maintenance or extended downtime, attempt to reconnect no more quickly than once every 5 seconds. There is no advantage to reconnecting more rapidly after maintenance during cancel_only mode.
