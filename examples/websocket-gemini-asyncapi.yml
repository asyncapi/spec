    Market data is a public API that streams all the market data on a given
    symbol.


    You can quickly play with the API using
    [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat#installation) like this:

    ```bash

    websocat wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/btcusd?heartbeat=true -S

            The semantics of entry type filtering is:


            If any entry type is specified as true or false, all of them must be
            explicitly flagged true to show up in the response

            If no entry types filtering parameters are included in the url, then
            all entry types will appear in the response
