                    - `/do-not-merge` or `/dnm` - This comment will block automerging even if all conditions are met and ready-to-merge label is added
                    - `/autoupdate` or `/au` - This comment will add `autoupdate` label to the PR and keeps your PR up-to-date to the target branch's future changes. Unless there is a merge conflict or it is a draft PR.`
