# Release Process For AsyncAPI Specification

This document is ment to explain the release process of the AsyncAPI specification. Goal of this document is to describe all details of the process so that any member of the community can jump in and help coordinating.

## Release coordinator

AsyncAPI specification release involves not only spec release but also the release of AsyncAPI-maintained tools, therefore it requires a single person called `release coordinator` that makes sure the release goes well through out all phases.

Release coordinator doesn't have to do all the work on her/his own. Release coordinator needs to find the right people to do the work that is needed for a given phase and needs to engage as many people as needed.

## Release cadence

AsyncAPI releases happen on a regular basis in the following months:
- January
- April
- June
- September

Regular releases concern only major and minor releases. We do not know if next release is major or minor. This is a decision that depends on the proposals for changes in the specification and how much they affect specification and tooling.

Path releases are automatically released and published.

## Release phases

### Kick off

TODO: explain how to create release branches, how to name them and where they should be, in what repositories. Also explain that release notes draft PR must be started.

### Review and merge 

TODO: proposal phases, who reviews/accepts/merges, what are prerequisites for the merge, what happens after the merge. Remember about updating release notes on issue by issue case to not have it at the end of the release cycle. What about tooling updates? release candidates? After first merge we should already have draft PR to master opened in all required repos

### Ship it!

TODO: what needs to be done in json schema repo, what in parser repo. How to trigger release, when merge release notes, who to inform, social networks, communication, beer or wine!
